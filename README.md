                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Management Information System (ILO7013) is a core subject in the Final Year (Semester VII) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. The course focuses on the role of information systems in managing modern organizations, decision-making processes, and leveraging technology for competitive advantage.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Management Information Systems (MIS):

- **Information Systems in Global Business**: Role of IS in business, business processes, and global challenges.
- **E-Business & E-Commerce**: Digital markets, digital goods, and models for electronic business.
- **IT Infrastructure**: Hardware, software, data management, and networking technologies.
- **Business Intelligence**: Decision support systems (DSS), executive support systems (ESS), and knowledge management.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM).
- **Security & Ethics**: System security, ethical, and social issues in information systems.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding the strategic role of information systems is crucial for aligning technology with business goals. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through MIS.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.
